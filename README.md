# Edinburgh Golang Context Lightning talk

Presented as a 10 minute lightning talk at the Golang Edinburgh meetup - slides and content shamelessly ripped / adapted from https://github.com/pcrawfor/golanguk (Many thanks to Paul).

# Golang UK Talk

This talk was presented Aug.18, 2016 entitled "Beginners Guide to Context"

In this repo are the talk slides along with supporting code, images and assets.

In addition are notes made researching the talk along with a working version of the sample app that is demonstrated during the talk under the sample/app folder.

## Slides:

In order to view the slides you can use the golang present tool:

`present talk.slide`

You can then view it at: http://localhost:3999/talk.slide#1

Also included in the repo is a pdf copy of the slides.

## Sample App:

The sample application is implemented under the folder samples/app. It can be run locally by using:

`go run main.go`

Then accessed at localhost:3000, you can enter any email/password combination to access the app.

#### NOTE: This is a sample app meant to demonstrate use of the context package it does not do all the things a real web application should do so don't use it as a definitive example if building your own web applications.
